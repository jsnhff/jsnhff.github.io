I have new work included in a drive-in sound exhibition titled "Away Message" at <a href="http://www.sweetpasssculpturepark.com/">Sweet Pass Sculpture Park</a>. My piece will be broadcast alongside 45 international artists over a low-powered FM transmitter. It's live from January 10 - February 23, 2019. If you're driving through Dallas, tune in.
