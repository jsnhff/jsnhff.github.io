<a href="https://jason-huff.com/projects/american-pyscho/" title="American Psycho">American Psycho</a> — A conceptual artist's book with Mimi Cabell published by Traumawien (Vienna). The entire text of Bret Easton Ellis's novel was sent through Gmail, collecting Google's contextual ads which became footnotes, with Ellis's text then erased. Now has its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho_(conceptual_novel)">Wikipedia article</a>.
