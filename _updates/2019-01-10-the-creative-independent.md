I wrote a guide on <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-make-a-website-for-your-creative-work/"> How to make a website for your creative work</a> for <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/">The Creative Independent</a>. It's purpose is to help creative folk get their work on the internet so they can share it with the wider world. Shout out to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sean_suchara/?hl=en">Sean Suchara</a> for the illustrations. You can also find the post on <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90290257/how-to-make-a-website-for-your-creative-work">Fast Company</a>.
