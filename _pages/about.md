<p class="h1">I'm a designer and leader by trade, with years of experience building effective teams and powerful products. I focus on developing design strategies to best support artists around the world starting with work at <a href="http://www.etsy.com/" alt="Etsy">Etsy</a> in 2012 and now <a href="http://www.netflix.com/" alt="Netflix">Netflix’s</a> global studio. Beyond this, I'm also an artist, teacher, collaborator, and friend-from-the-internet who’s most excited when I'm helping to make awesome things real.</p>

<p class="sm-col-12 md-col-10 lg-col-11 columns">In my creative work, I cohabitate between the realms of art, theory, and technology. I've been a NEW INC mentor, a Rhizome contributor, a host of <a href="http://www.livingroomlightexchange.com/lrlxny/" alt="LRLX">Living Room Light Exchange NY</a>, an adjunct faculty member at Parsons/The New School, and a visiting critic at <a href="https://www.risd.edu/" alt="RISD" title="risd.edu">RISD</a>—where I also earned my MFA in Digital Media.
<br><br>
While at RISD, I worked on two projects that are now archived in MoMA’s library. The first, "<a href="http://p-dpa.net/work/autosummarize/">AutoSummarize</a>," is a publication cataloguing algorithmically generated summaries of the top 100 most-downloaded copyright-free books. The second, "<a href="http://p-dpa.net/work/american-psycho/">American Psycho</a>," appropriated the entire text of the popular Bret Easton Ellis novel into a series of emails, and then saved the relational ads generated by the exchange. These internet-embodied projects went on to inform my project-based work, which continues to take a critical, curious, and often humorous approach to dissecting the many tentacles of our digital tools and habits. To learn more about my work, check out this essay I wrote about my project, the “<a href="https://themechanicalturkdiaries.com/" alt="Link to Mechanical Turk Diaries">Mechanical Turk Diaries</a>,” for <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/serf-boards/" alt="The New Inquiry">The New Inquiry</a>.</p>

<p class="sm-col-12 md-col-10 lg-col-11 mt3">After years spent living and working in NYC, I now live in LA. I’d love to hear from you, wherever you are, and can be reached by <a href="mailto:jsnhff+website@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
