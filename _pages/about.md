<p class="h1">I'm a designer and manager by trade, with years of experience leading and building effective teams and powerful products. I focus on developing design strategies to best support artists and entrepreneurs around the world, starting with work at <a href="http://www.etsy.com/" alt="Etsy">Etsy</a> in 2012, then at <a href="http://www.netflix.com/" alt="Netflix">Netflix</a> from 2019–2023, and now at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" alt="Shopify">Shopify</a> since 2024 helping bring creative businesses to life. Beyond this, I'm also an artist, teacher, collaborator, and friend-from-the-internet who's most excited when I'm helping to make awesome things real.</p>

<p class="sm-col-12 md-col-10 lg-col-11 columns py3">In my creative work, I cohabitate between the realms of art, theory, and technology. I've been a NEW INC mentor, a Rhizome contributor, a host of <a href="http://www.livingroomlightexchange.com/lrlxny/" alt="LRLX">Living Room Light Exchange NY</a>, an adjunct faculty member at Parsons/The New School, and a visiting critic at <a href="https://www.risd.edu/" alt="RISD" title="risd.edu">RISD</a>—where I also earned my MFA in Digital Media.
<br><br>
While at RISD, I worked on two projects that are now part of <a href="https://soulellis.com/entries/lotpw.html">MoMA's permanent collection</a> (acquired as part of the Library of the Printed Web in 2017). The first, "<a href="https://jason-huff.com/projects/autosummarize/">AutoSummarize</a>," is a publication cataloguing algorithmically generated summaries of the top 100 most-downloaded copyright-free books—relaunched for its <a href="https://specificideas.com/autosummarize">10th anniversary in 2023</a> with Specific Ideas and Adam Lucas. The second, "<a href="https://jason-huff.com/projects/american-pyscho/">American Psycho</a>," a collaboration with Mimi Cabell, appropriated the entire text of the Bret Easton Ellis novel into a series of emails, then saved the relational ads generated by the exchange. American Psycho now has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho_(conceptual_novel)">its own Wikipedia article</a>.
<br><br>
Both projects have been included in major anthologies: MIT Press's <i><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262549813/output/">Output: An Anthology of Computer-Generated Text, 1953–2023</a></i> (2024), University of Alabama Press's <i><a href="https://www.uapress.ua.edu/9780817360412/conceptualisms/">Conceptualisms</a></i> (2022), and Spector Books' <i><a href="https://www.spectorbooks.com/book/library-of-artistic-print-on-demand">Library of Artistic Print on Demand</a></i> (2025). In 2023, I participated in a panel on AI and bookmaking at LA Art Book Fair's <a href="https://www.hauserwirth.com/news/42514-la-art-book-fair-returns-hauser-wirth-publishers-and-printed-matter-host-mornings-in-the-garden-in-downtown-los-angeles/">Mornings in the Garden</a>, co-presented by Hauser & Wirth Publishers and Printed Matter.
<br><br>
These internet-embodied projects continue to inform my work, which takes a critical, curious, and often humorous approach to dissecting the many tentacles of our digital tools and habits. To learn more, check out this essay I wrote about my project, the "<a href="https://themechanicalturkdiaries.com/" alt="Link to Mechanical Turk Diaries">Mechanical Turk Diaries</a>," for <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/serf-boards/" alt="The New Inquiry">The New Inquiry</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h3">Helping Creative Entrepreneurs</h2>
<p class="mb3">I'm at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" alt="Shopify">Shopify</a> as Design Director, leading talented designers who help entrepreneurs build and grow their creative businesses—from artists and makers to innovative retail experiences.</p>
<h2 class="h3">Supporting Talented Friends</h2>
<p>I'm supporting friends' creative ventures:</p>
<ol class="mb3">
	<li><a href="https://gather.glass/" alt="Gather Glass">Gather Glass</a> &mdash; my friend Phoebe Stubbs' London-based glassblowing studio creating bold, handmade glassware. Each piece is designed by Phoebe and handmade by her talented team of glass artisans.</li>
	<li><a href="https://naominomi.com/" alt="Naomi Nomi">Naomi Nomi</a> &mdash; a brilliant direct-to-consumer women's workwear brand in NYC that believes clothes should change to fit womens' bodies, and not the other way around.</li>

<h2 class="h3">Learning & Making</h2>
<p>I'm following interests on topics of technology, contemporary art, design history, economics, and the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studying the intersection of technology, economics, and anthropology.</li>
<li>Scheming more radical ways to fund artists with <a href="http://kelaninichole.com/" alt="Kelani Nichole">Kelani Nichole</a>. If you have ideas, <a href="mailto:jsnhff+radical@gmail.com">please reach out</a>.</li>
<li>Collaborating with freelancers on a new sculpture and software for books.</li>
</ul>
