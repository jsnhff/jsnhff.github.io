            <div class="work-title">Creative Practice</div>
            <div class="work-description">In my creative work, I explore the intersection of art, theory, and technology. I've been a NEW INC mentor, Rhizome contributor, and adjunct faculty at Parsons/The New School. My projects "American Psycho" (with Mimi Cabell) and "AutoSummarize" are archived in MoMA's permanent collection and have been included in major anthologies including MIT Press's <i>Output: An Anthology of Computer-Generated Text, 1953–2023</i> (2024) and University of Alabama Press's <i>Conceptualisms</i> (2022).</div>

            <div class="work-description">I hold an MFA in Digital Media from RISD. In 2023, I relaunched AutoSummarize for its 10th anniversary with Specific Ideas and Adam Lucas, and participated in a panel on AI and bookmaking at LA Art Book Fair's Mornings in the Garden, co-presented by Hauser & Wirth Publishers and Printed Matter. American Psycho has its own Wikipedia article and continues to be featured in academic writing and institutional exhibitions.</div>
