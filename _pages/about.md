Jason Huff is a designer and leader by trade, with years of experience building effective teams and powerful products. He focuses on developing design strategies to best support artists around the world starting with work at <a hreff="http://www.etsy.com/" alt="Etsy">Etsy</a> in 2012 and now <a href="http://www.netflix.com/" alt="Netflix">Netflix’s</a> global studio. Beyond this, he’s also an artist, teacher, collaborator, and friend-from-the-internet who’s most excited when he’s helping to make awesome things real.

In his creative work, Jason cohabitates between the realms of art, theory, and technology. He has been a NEW INC mentor, a Rhizome contributor, a host of <a href="http://www.livingroomlightexchange.com/lrlxny/" alt="LRLX">Living Room Light Exchange</a>, an adjunct faculty member at Parsons/The New School, and a visiting critic at <a href="https://www.risd.edu/" alt="RISD" title="risd.edu">RISD</a>—where he also earned his MFA in Digital Media.

While at RISD, Jason worked on two projects that are now archived in MoMA’s library. The first, "<a href="http://p-dpa.net/work/autosummarize/">AutoSummarize</a>," is a publication cataloguing algorithmically generated summaries of the top 100 most-downloaded copyright-free books. The second, "<a href="http://p-dpa.net/work/american-psycho/">American Psycho</a>," appropriated the entire text of the popular Bret Easton Ellis novel into a series of emails, and then saved the relational ads generated by the exchange. These internet-embodied projects went on to inform Jason’s project-based work, which continues to take a critical, curious, and often humorous approach to dissecting the many tentacles of our digital tools and habits. To learn more about Jason’s work, read an essay he wrote about his project, the “Mechanical Turk Diaries,” for <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/serf-boards/" alt="The New Inquiry">The New Inquiry</a>.

After years spent living and working in NYC, Jason now lives in LA. He’d love to hear from you, wherever you are, and can be reached by <a href="mailto:jsnhff+website@gmail.com">email</a>.
